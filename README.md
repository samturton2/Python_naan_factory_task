# Naan factory Task

### Summary

TDD bread factory is the latest bread brand in Py Land. It always produces the best bread because it has the best testing strategy!
What they do is before they make any new bread, they make a test to make sure the end output is correct. Then they adjust the recipe until it's just right!

### TDD - test driven development

1. write the test
2. run it, and read the error
3. code and make it pass the test

this helps with:
- Stop over engineering
- Maintainable code
- Reduce technical debt
- Goes well with agile and working code
- errors can be your guide in complex systems
